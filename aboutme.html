	<p>Hi! My name is Paarth Joshi and I am currently a freshman at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying computer science.
	In high school, I was the captain of my varsity soccer team, Vice-President of my BPA (Business Professionals of America) chapter, and part of the executive board of the Computer Science Club. 
	My hobbies include logic puzzles, playing sports, and traveling. Fun fact: I was named a reserve to the USA U-15 national cricket team in 2009.</p>
	
	<p>While at UIUC, I am interested in joining an a cappella group, ACM, the men's club soccer team, and studying abroad. I'm looking forward to my next four years in one of the best computer science programs in the country! </p>
	
	<p>	Take a second to look at my <a href="assets/Resume-FirstnameLastname.pdf">r�sum�</a>!</p>
